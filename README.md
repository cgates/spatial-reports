# Guidelines for downstream analysis

- Set the working directory to the directory containing this README. We recommend using a [Project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) in Rstudio.
- Use [install_dependencies.R](install_dependencies.R) to install all packages used in these reports.

## Quick Start

This repository contains templates for COSMX and Visium[HD] data. Inside each folder you will find the different analyses we have available now.

### Install Dependencies with Rstudio

```
source("install_depedencies.R")
```
### Install Test Data with Rstudio

**Visium HD**

This script will download the [test data](https://zenodo.org/records/15784846) needed for the visium reports.

```
source("visium/download-test-data.R")
```

## Downstream analysis

Before using any template, go the `VISUM` or `COSMX` folder and:

1. **Modify** [information.R](information.R) with the right information. You can use this file with any template to include the project/analysis information.
2. **Modify** the `YAML` header of the `qmd` files to choose the right parameters for that report.

- For Visium, we work from Seurat objects.

### Quality assessment

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-grey) [cosmx/01_quality_assessment/qc.Rmd](cosmx/01_quality_assessment/qc.Rmd) is a template for **COSMX** QC metrics.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-grey) [visium/01_quality_assessment/qc.Rmd](cosmx/01_quality_assessment/quality_assessment.qmd) is a template for **Visium[HD]** QC metrics.

### Clustering and Annotation

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-grey) [visium/02_clustering_annotation/02_Clustering_Annotation.rmd](visium/02_clustering_annotation/02_Clustering_Annotation.rmd) is a template for clustering and annotation with Seurat and [Banksy](https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy) (clustering spatial omics data) and [spacexr](https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr) (cell type identification and cell type-specific differential expression in spatial transcriptomics).
